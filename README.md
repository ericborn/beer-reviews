### beer-reviews
This analysis was performed on a dataset consists of 1.5M beer reviews from the website Beeradvocate.com. The set includes various pieces of information about the beer and the reviewers impressions of the taste. I chose to focus my analysis on the ABV, beer name, beer style and the overall impression categories.
